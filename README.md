# monopolyDigital
This is an independent project from CU Boulder's CSCI 1300 "Starting Computing" course, in collaboration with Charlotte Gorgemans. It is a command line-based digital version of the board game "Monopoly", with most features of the games (e.g. Cards, Bankruptcy, Property Ownership) included.
